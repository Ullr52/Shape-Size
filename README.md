# Shape-Size
A simple java program which utilizes Maven support with a pom.xml and appropriate dependency/dependencies. 

This program tests the Shape.java and ShapeBusLogic.java by using assertEquals, assertTrue, and assertFalse on methods calculateShapeSize, calculateShapebyEqualSides, 
and identifyShapeIsRectangle.


Users can test the project by downloading and changing the numbers provided in the TestShapeLogic.java and seeing if the test passes or 
fails and what errors are received when the asserts are different from what is expected.
